The visualizations shows how the shortest path can be find using a BFS algorithm. The program uses `tkinter` for a GUI window such that you are able to give some input (the start and end points) and `pygame` for the animation. It can be used in learning purposes.

## Run the visualization
Make sure that you have installed all the needed libraries. Open terminal and make sure that your working directory is `./Shortest-Path-Visualizer/Path Visualization/`. Then execute the following command:
```
python Path_Visualization.py
```
